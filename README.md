Project Objective:
To Complete the features of the application by planning the development in terms of sprints
and then push the source code to the GitHub repository. The user interaction will be via
command line.

Project Overview:
This project is designed to perform operations on file names from the directory present in
the application. This project will perform operations like listing files in ascending order,
adding a file to the directory, deleting a file from the directory or Searching a file if exists in
the directory or not. We will build the command line project with basic UI, which will display
the main menu, which has operations such as listing files, Secondary operations, exit option.
The secondary menu has operations such as add file to the directory, delete file from the
directory, searching for a file in the directory.

Sprint Planning:

I have divided the project in four sprints for proper maintenance of the project

Sprint 1: In the first sprint, I have planned about the requirements and analyzed the java
concepts required to create this project.

Sprint 2: In the Second sprint, I have initialized the initial template of the application like
Welcome Screen, Main menu, Secondary Menu.

Sprint 3: In the Third sprint, I have written the code for the main menu options like list the
files in ascending order, function for secondary menu and exit option.

Sprint 4: In the fourth sprint, I have written the code for the secondary options like adding a
file to the directory, deleting a file from the directory, Searching for a file in the directory,
and a function to go back to the main menu.

Java Concepts used:
• Class, Objects, methods, variables, datatypes
• Exceptional Handling
• File handling
• Arrays and its methods
• Collections(TreeSet)
• Scanner class and methods
• Looping Statements
• Conditional Statements


Conclusion : This project runs on Command line UI, so we can add proper Frontend and
also perform file operations like writing in the file viewing the file etc
